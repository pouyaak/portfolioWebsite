                    I thrive on challenges, continuously seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and tackle meaningful projects that push me beyond my limits. In team environments, I bring a kind, supportive, and collaborative spirit, paired with strong leadership qualities. I believe in empowering my teammates and leading by example to drive success in any project I undertake.
